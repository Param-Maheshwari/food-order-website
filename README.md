**4. Algorithms Used For Queue : -**

**Shortest Job First (SJF)**

Order with less time will come in queue above the order which will take more time to prepare and will be completed first.

**First Come First Serve (FCFS)**

If the time of both the order is same then the order which entered first in the queue will be completed first.
